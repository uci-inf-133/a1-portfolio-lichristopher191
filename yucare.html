      <p>
        We found inspiration in the inefficiencies of urgent care hospitals, especially their long wait times and outdated check-in processes.
        Many of us have recently been to urgent care for different reasons, and while sharing our experiences, we found the entire process of being checked to be outdated, inefficient, and in dire need of improvement. While researching, I came across statistics that proved that our experiences were shared with many other patients.

        A Critical Issue in Healthcare: An Inefficient Urgent Care System.
        In emergency situations, timely access to medical care is essential, yet many patients face significant delays during the check-in process at urgent care facilities. This inefficiency is particularly problematic and frustrating for individuals with life-threatening conditions who require immediate attention.

        Conclusion: My most important takeaways.
        Importance of Accessibility: Often overlooked, I never realized how inaccessible everyday tasks could be for those with disabilities, especially those with vision problems attempting to navigate the internet. I understand that, as the lead designer for my team, I had to consistently produce and maintain accessible content to ensure we could reach our entire target audience, which includes those with disabilities as well.
        User-Friendly Interfaces: Although this might sound obvious, one of my most valuable takeaways is that I need to design with the eyes of the end user, not with my eyes. Certain aspects might seem intuitive to my own eyes but confusing to other users. Conducting usability testing and ensuring to get constant feedback from my peers, team, and teachers helped improve our project as well as my design skills.
