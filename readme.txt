--Readme document for *Christopher Li*, *chril52@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

- Images --> profile image, project images, and project header image with alt text
- Clear heading hierarchy and paragraph text
= Links to linkedin, resume, canva, devpost, and figma
- Semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, section, article, figure)
- Custom icons using Font Awesome


(b) CSS features

- Modified margins and padding to improve readability
- Used color pallete with consistent branding (greens/neutrals)
- Custom Google Font (Poppins)

(c) Advanced features

- Nabigation bar
- Leveraged HTML forms


3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

I ignored one warning on my style.css file warning related to vendor-specific font fallbacks, which were intentionally included to ensure consistent typography across different operating systems.

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

5-6 hours.

5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

Poppins Font --> https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?preview.lang=en_Latn
Font Awesome --> https://fontawesome.com/
Help with HTML Forms --> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form

I asked ChatGPT about how to embed custom fonts (poppins) and debugging errors for accessibility that popped up.

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

I did not consult other classmates for this assignment. 

7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

No, thank you!
